Problem

To access Raspberry Pi GPIO, we can use several GPIO libraries.

Solution

If you are working with Python, Raspbian will have already
installed the RPi.GPIO library to access Raspberry Pi GPIO.
Discussion
You can verify the RPi.GPIO library from a Python terminal by
importing the RPi.GPIO module, as shown in the following screenshot:
If you don't find this library on Python runtime or get the error
message ImportError: No module named RPi.GPIO, you can install it by
compiling from the source code. For instance, we want to install RPi.GPIO
0.5.11, so type the following commands:
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ wget
https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/R/RPi.GPIO/RPi.GPIO-
0.5.11.tar.gz
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ tar -xvzf RPi.GPIO-0.5.11.tar.gz
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ cd RPi.GPIO-0.5.11/
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo python setup.py install
