Problem

You want to make a buzzing sound with the Raspberry Pi using touch
sensor.

Solution

These example programs show you how to use the capacitive touch
sensors with Python and the Raspberry Pi's GPIO. It is relatively
straightforward to adapt the programs to do different things. Just change
the lines with print "pressed".
Two versions of the code are provided. One will continuously print
output to the terminal while the touch sensor is pressed. The other will
only print output once, irrelevant of how long the pad is pressed. Both
pieces of code will work with the momentary and toggle boards.
Continuous Output:
This version of the code will continuously print output while the
pad is pressed.
import time
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
padPin = 23
GPIO.setup(padPin, GPIO.IN)
while True:
padPressed = GPIO.input(padPin)
if padPressed:
print "pressed"
time.sleep(0.1)
Single Output:
This version of the Python code will only print an output once each
time the sensor detects a touch.
import time
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
padPin = 23
GPIO.setup(padPin, GPIO.IN)
alreadyPressed = False
while True:
padPressed = GPIO.input(padPin)
if padPressed and not alreadyPressed:
print "pressed"
alreadyPressed = padPressed
time.sleep(0.1)
Running the Code:
Open a terminal. Move to the directory that you saved the code and
type in the following command (change the file name to whatever you
called your Python file):
$ sudo python touchsensor.py
